12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,960
we should look into microservices.
我们应该研究一下微服务。

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,250
But it is critical to understand what exactly it is and how to implement it correctly.

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,180
My goal is to introduce you to the microservices architecture while giving you a real world project
我的目标是向你介绍微服务架构，同时为你提供一个真实世界的项目

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,980
to see how microservices communicate with each other and what are the problems that we encounter and

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,450
to microservices than that.
微服务

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,130
But as microservices are composed of individual APIs, we will be spending quite some time in building

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,440
small APIs.

22
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:46,370
And then we will focus on the key concept of how individual API communicates with each other and how

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,910
the microservices architecture comes together.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:58,440
We will be building seven small API's in this course, including one API that will be responsible for

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,420
authentication and we will do that using Dotnet identity.
我们将使用 Dotnet 身份进行验证。

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,140
Once we build the APIs, then we will see how API communicates with each other.
一旦我们构建了应用程序接口，我们就会看到应用程序接口是如何相互通信的。

27
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,320
One of the most frustrating thing when you are learning something is when the course is outdated, because
在学习过程中，最令人沮丧的事情之一就是课程过时了，因为
