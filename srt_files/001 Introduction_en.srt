00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,080
Are you looking to learn what microservices are?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,200
Or are you trying to get started and gain some real world hands on experience with.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,060
Net microservices.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,630
If yes, then you are at the right course.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,230
My name is Brogan and welcome to the course.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,410
Net Core Microservices.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,800
The Complete Guide.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,600
Microservices is one of the buzzword in programming.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,700
If you look for a new job, microservices is one of the key features that is coming up more and more

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,480
often.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,440
Every time a system is lagging or it is getting too big, someone will have a suggestion that maybe

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,960
we should look into microservices.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,250
But it is critical to understand what exactly it is and how to implement it correctly.

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,260
That is my motivation behind this course.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,180
My goal is to introduce you to the microservices architecture while giving you a real world project

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,980
to see how microservices communicate with each other and what are the problems that we encounter and

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,300
how to solve them.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:26,500
Microservices is made up of individual projects in simple terms, but in reality there is much more

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,450
to microservices than that.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:37,130
But as microservices are composed of individual APIs, we will be spending quite some time in building

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,440
small APIs.

22
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:46,370
And then we will focus on the key concept of how individual API communicates with each other and how

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,910
the microservices architecture comes together.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:58,440
We will be building seven small API's in this course, including one API that will be responsible for

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,420
authentication and we will do that using Dotnet identity.

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:11,140
Once we build the APIs, then we will see how API communicates with each other.

27
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,320
One of the most frustrating thing when you are learning something is when the course is outdated, because

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,100
of which I will always try to keep the content up to date.

29
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,290
That way you will not be struggling with what is different in the new version.

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,150
If you are excited about what microservices are and you want to learn by building a real world project

31
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,230
in microservices, this is the course you are looking for.

32
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,470
I hope you will join me in this exciting journey of microservices.

33
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,480
And let me show you what we will build in this course in the next video.
